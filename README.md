# MSK KO village cell typing

Annotate cell types for MSK KO village scRNAseq data.


The final cell type annoation is saved in ```output/MSK_KO_village_meta_data.csv```.


## Summary of clusters

```output/_cluster_summary/cluster_summary_heatmap.pdf``` illustrates the distributoin of cells within each cluster across samples or time points. 

```output/_cluster_summary/cluster_summary_res_0.5.xlsx``` summarizes the marker genes and cell type of each cluster.

This [figure](output/figures/cluster_vs_markers_heatmap.pdf) illusrates the marker genes of each cluster.
